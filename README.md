# Comparing-Cartograms-Effectiveness-in-Geographic-Transformation
A small study performed to support a paper comparing cartograms' effectiveness in geographic transformation. 

This study uses contiguous, non-contiguous, and Dorling cartograms to visualise the population of northern European countries
in 2005.
The aim of this study was to back up arguments previously made in the paper, exploring which cartograms were more or less effective 
in transforming geographic data.
